\section{Limitations and Threats to Validity}
\label{sec:limits}

This study has clear scope boundaries:

\begin{itemize}
\item Evaluation was performed on one Linux environment and loopback/local-host paths.
\item Interop matrix validates bidirectional Go $\leftrightarrow$ C++ exchange, but does not exhaust all SCTP extensions.
\item The current harness does not benchmark high-throughput bulk transfer against tuned TCP/UDP baselines.
\item Multihoming failover scenarios were not fully exercised in a multi-interface fault-injection lab.
\end{itemize}

These limitations do not invalidate the central result (integration feasibility plus interop correctness), but they constrain generalization of quantitative performance conclusions.

Future work should include multi-host and multi-path experiments, scheduler/interleaving extension coverage, and comparative workload benchmarks for message-centric applications.
