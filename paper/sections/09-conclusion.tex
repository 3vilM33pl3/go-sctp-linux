\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper presented a Linux-focused SCTP integration into a modern Go runtime and evaluated it with in-tree tests plus Go<->C++ interoperability scenarios. The evidence supports the main claim: SCTP can and should be treated as a first-class transport next to TCP and UDP in runtime networking APIs.

The broader point is architectural. Internet protocol design expects extensibility, and SCTP is a mature transport standard that addresses real application needs without forcing ad hoc reimplementation at higher layers. The implementation in this repository demonstrates that enabling SCTP in a mainstream runtime is not a disruptive redesign; it is an incremental, testable extension of existing networking abstractions.

Treating SCTP as first-class is therefore both technically justified and operationally practical.
