\begin{abstract}
This paper revisits a 2013 SCTP-in-Go implementation and re-establishes the design on Linux in a modern Go runtime tree. The central claim is that SCTP should be treated as a first-class transport protocol next to TCP and UDP, not as an exotic add-on. The argument is architectural and empirical: Internet protocol layering was designed to evolve, SCTP is a mature IETF transport, and practical integration in a contemporary runtime is straightforward when the networking stack is already protocol-agnostic at key extension points. We describe the Linux integration in Go's \texttt{net} package, show API parity with existing TCP/UDP patterns, and evaluate interoperability against an independent C++ endpoint built on Linux SCTP APIs. Results show that the implementation passes in-tree SCTP tests and bilateral Go<->C++ interop scenarios while preserving SCTP-specific metadata such as stream identifier and PPID. The outcome supports a broader position: modern language runtimes should expose SCTP as a standard transport option for message-oriented and resilience-aware applications rather than forcing all designs through TCP or UDP.
